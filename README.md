# Minimalistic Twitter clone
Blog web application

A simple web app with authentication and blog-posts management. As my first contact with web development, this project helped me a lot in understanding how frameworks actually work and in testing the capabilities of the Python language.

## Setup
First, you need to intall the project in the virtual environment, by using the command:
```
pip install -e .
```

The next step is to load the application:
Unix Bash
```
export FLASK_APP=
```
Windows CMD
```
set FLASK_APP=
```

## Run
Simply execute the command:

```
flask run
```
